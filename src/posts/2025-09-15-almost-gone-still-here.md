There are eight days left until I leave Vancouver.

I’ve been quietly preparing for this moment — not just the logistics of departure, but the emotional shift that comes with it. The site you're reading now, xy.remainoff.com, is more or less ready. It’s not meant to be public in the usual sense. It’s a personal space, a quiet archive. A place to document what I don’t usually share — the in-between thoughts, the subtle changes, the things that don’t ask to be heard.

Lately, I’ve been working on body improvement. Eating better. Showing up at the gym. Not for transformation, but for presence — to feel more aligned with myself before the next chapter begins. I suppose this site will become a record of that too. Not just how I look, but how I feel. How I move through time.

We’re all aging. One day we’ll look back and see how different we were — not just in appearance, but in posture, in expression, in the way we held ourselves. I want to remember that. I want to see it clearly.

I’ll be gradually updating the Photo Collection Galleries here. They’re not meant to impress. They’re meant to reflect. To hold moments still, even as everything else moves.

This image feels like a beginning. Or maybe a pause before the beginning. Either way, it belongs here.
